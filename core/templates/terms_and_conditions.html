        violations of these Terms, unilaterally determine whether you have violated them, and take 
        actions as per relevant regulations without your consent or prior notice. Such actions may

        3. Digital Currency Services:<br>
        Your digital currency wallet allows you to initiate digital currency transactions, including sending 
        digital currency to your virtual card and receiving and storing digital currency from third parties 
        through instructions provided on the Bfree website. Each such transaction is referred to as a 
        "Digital Currency Transaction."<br>
        All digital currency transactions are executed based on your instructions, and you agree that you 
        are responsible for verifying all information related to the instructions you submit. We do not 
        verify the identity of any user, recipient, requester, or other party involved in the transaction.<br>
        Once a Digital Currency Transaction is broadcasted to the relevant digital currency network, it 
        cannot be reversed. The transaction will remain unconfirmed for a certain period while awaiting 
        confirmation from the digital currency network. During this pending state, the transaction is not 
        considered complete, and any digital currency associated with it will be designated as pending 
        and will not be included in your digital currency wallet balance or available for further 
        transactions.<br>
        We may apply network fees (miner fees) to process Digital Currency Transactions on your behalf. 
        The calculation of these fees is at our discretion, but we will always notify you of the fee before 
        authorizing the transaction.<br>
        We reserve the right to refuse to process or cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as 
        required by law or by order of any court or authority to which Bfree is subject in any jurisdiction.<br>
        Supported Digital Currencies:<br>
        Our Digital Currency Services are exclusively available for the digital currencies supported by 
        Bfree, and this may change periodically. It's crucial not to attempt to utilize your Digital Currency 
        Wallet for storing, sending, requesting, or receiving digital currencies that are not supported by 
        us. Bfree reserves the right to make reasonable efforts to assist you in moving or selling digital 
        currency that we no longer support, provided it was previously listed on Bfree when stored in 
        your Wallet. Bfree bears no responsibility or liability for any attempt to use your Digital Currency 
        Wallet for digital currencies we do not support.<br>
        Third-Party Payments:<br>
        We do not guarantee that a third-party buyer or seller you transact with will fulfill the transaction 
        or is authorized to do so. Any issues with goods or services purchased from or sold to a third party 
        using Digital Currency transferred via Bfree Digital Currency Services should be resolved directly 
        with that third party.<br>

        risks and accept that we are not obligated to assist you in moving or selling an unsupported

        <br><b>VIRTUAL CARD</b>
        <br>Bfree offers Virtual Cards that is linked with our virtual wallet. Please refer to our card usage
        <br>1. Card fees
        <br>• Card issuing - $10
        <br>• Monthly maintenance/subscription fee - $2
        <br>• For every failed card transaction due to insufficient balance while transacting - $0.5
        <br>• FX Transactions (Transactions made outside of the US) - exchange fee of 8% and $0.9 per 
        transaction
        <br>2. Card funding
        The minimum amount that can be added to a card is $2 in a single card funding transaction, whilst 
        the maximum amount is $1000, a card can hold up to $10,000
        <br>3. Card transaction
        How the card subscription works: Card subscription/maintenance deduction only happens on 
        your USD wallet. If there’s no money in your USD wallet, we then withdraw $2 from your card 
        and move it to your USD wallet where the deduction would eventually happen. We only withdraw 
        from your card when your card balance is at least $2, this is because we require a minimum card 
        balance of $2 after withdrawal. At every point we try to deduct from your card we send 
        notifications. If after the third retry from our end, there’s no money in your USD wallet or card 
        to pay your monthly subscription, we delete your card.
        <br>How the card fx transaction fees work: Foreign exchange fees happen when you make a card 
        payment outside of the US, our cards are US-denominated cards. When you pay for a service or 
        product in the US, there are no foreign exchange fees, but when you pay for a service or product 
        outside of the US, we charge a foreign exchange fee of 8% and $0.9 per transaction. E.g. when 
        you pay for an item in the UK costing $100, we charge $8 plus $0.9, which is $8 for that 
        transaction. FX fee deduction happens in your USD wallet, if there’s no money in your USD wallet, 
        it goes into negative, then we do an exchange from your base wallet to your USD wallet to clear 
        the negative.
        <br>How the failed transaction fees work: For every payment initiated with an insufficient balance, 
        we impose a penalty fee of $0.5. E.g. assuming you have a recurrent bill running for Netflix and 
        you are to pay on the 1st of every month, when Netflix comes for their money on the 1st and you 
        have less than the amount in your card, it means the transaction fails, that will attract a fee of 
        $0.5 and we charge the USD wallet directly unless there’s no money in your USD wallet then it 
        goes into negatives, which we can then exchange from your base wallet to USD to clear the 
        negative.
        <br>Please note that if you request a new card after the termination or deletion of a previous card, a 
        fee for creating a new card will be applicable.

        to our risk management and security protocols. You agree that we are not obligated to disclose 
        the details of our risk management and security procedures to you. The Platform may employ
